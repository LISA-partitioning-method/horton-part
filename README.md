[HORTON-PART](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/horton-part) is a computational chemistry package that supports different partition schemes.It is based on the sub-module `part` of `HORTON2`, which is written and maintained by Toon Verstraelen (1).

In HORTON3, all sub-modules have been rewritten using the pure Python programming language to support Python 3+. The 'part' module has also been rewritten and is now called [denspart](https://github.com/theochem/denspart) module.

However, the algorithm implemented in `denspart` only uses one-step optimization, which can be computationally expensive for large systems. Additionally, `denspart` only supports the `MBIS` partitioning scheme.

Another `part` module has been rewritten in pure Python programming language by Farnaz Heidar-Zadeh (2). However, the integration grid implemented in this module still uses the old 'grid' from Horton2. [HORTON-PART](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/horton-part) with version `0.0.X` is based on this module. Starting from version `1.X.X`, [HORTON-PART](https://github.com/yingxingcheng/horton-part) supports the new integration [qc-grid](https://github.com/theochem/grid).

This version contains contributions from YingXing Cheng (1), Toon Verstraelen (1), Pawel Tecmer (2), Farnaz Heidar-Zadeh (2), Cristina E. Gonz√°lez-Espinoza (2), Matthew Chan (2), Taewon D. Kim (2), Katharina Boguslawski (2), Stijn Fias (3), Steven Vandenbrande (1), Diego Berrocal (2), and Paul W. Ayers (2)
