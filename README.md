/ (..) \ Welcome to HORTON-PART!
\/ || \/
 |_''_|  HORTON-PART is a computational chemistry package that supports different
         partition schemes. It is based on the sub-module 'part' of HORTON2,
         which is written and maintained by Toon Verstraelen (1).

         In HORTON3, all sub-modules have been rewritten using the pure Python
         programming language to support Python 3+. The 'part' module has also been
         rewritten and is now called 'denspart' module.
         (see https://github.com/theochem/denspart for more details).

         However, the algorithm implemented in 'denspart' only uses one-step
         optimization, which can be computationally expensive for large systems.
         Additionally, 'denspart' only supports the 'MBIS' partitioning scheme.

         Another 'part' module has been rewritten in pure Python programming language
         by Farnaz Heidar-Zadeh (2). However, the integration grid implemented in
         this module still uses the old 'grid' from Horton2. HORTON-PART version
         0.X.X is based on this module. Starting from version 1.X.X, HORTON-PART
         supports the new integration 'grid' (https://github.com/theochem/grid).

         This version contains contributions from YingXing Cheng (1), Toon Verstraelen (1),
         Pawel Tecmer (2), Farnaz Heidar-Zadeh (2), Cristina E. Gonz√°lez-Espinoza (2),

         The purpose of this log file is to track the progress and quality of a
         computation. Useful numerical output may be written to a checkpoint
         file and is accessible through the Python scripting interface.
